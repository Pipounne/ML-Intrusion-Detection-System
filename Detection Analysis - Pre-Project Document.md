# 1. Business Challenge and State-of-the-Art

## Business Challenge  
Intrusion detection is a crucial component of modern cybersecurity, helping organizations identify unauthorized access and mitigate security risks in real-time. This project will use the NSL-KDD dataset to analyze network traffic data for intrusion detection, exploring patterns in normal versus malicious activity and identifying effective ways to classify different types of attacks.
## State-of-the-Art  
Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) employ machine learning models to identify network anomalies. The NSL-KDD dataset is widely used in IDS research and addresses some limitations of the original KDD Cup 1999 dataset, such as removing redundant records, which can improve analysis accuracy. Drawing from Tim Goodfellow’s exploration of this dataset, we aim to investigate feature importance, develop classification models, and assess model performance in distinguishing between attack and normal traffic.

# 2. Data Description and Data Sources

## Data Description  
The NSL-KDD dataset, available [on Kaggle here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd), contains labeled network traffic records for training and testing intrusion detection systems. 
Key attributes include:  
- Duration, Protocol Type, Service: Basic features describing network connection parameters.  
- Flag, Source Bytes, Destination Bytes: Indicators of packet flow and size.  
- Land, Wrong Fragment, Urgent: Indicators of potentially malicious activity.  
- Label: Class labels indicating normal traffic or various attack types (e.g., DoS, probe, U2R, R2L).
## Data Sources  
The primary dataset source is Kaggle, but additional data sources on network intrusion detection or specific attack types may be used to enhance understanding and model performance.

# 3. Business Objectives and Scope

## Objectives  
The objectives of this project are to:  
- Identify distinguishing features between normal and malicious network traffic.  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to classify traffic as normal or as one of the attack types.  
- Examine the model’s performance on specific attack types to improve the detection rate of less frequent attack categories.
## Scope  
This project will focus on:  
- Analyzing the NSL-KDD dataset’s network connection records.  
- Developing models to classify traffic types, focusing on improving accuracy for all four primary attack classes.  
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# 4. Work Plan

## Steps  
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and encode categorical features, normalize numerical features, and handle missing data if any.  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze feature distributions, identify correlations, and determine feature importance.  
3. Model Selection and Training: Test different classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM) to find the most effective model for intrusion detection.  
4. Evaluation and Tuning: Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and analyze model outputs.  
5. Insights and Visualization: Visualize classification results, feature importance, and performance metrics.
